# Zeus Selfbot - By .k and charge

This Selfbot Is One Of The Most Advanced On The Market And It's cheap

Has Been Coded From Scratch With Users Experience in Mind

This Is why it has been coded to allow users to change all aspects of the selbot appearance

So That they can tell their friends that they made it and there is no way that the anyone could prove you didn't make it

- Note: some of the networking commands only work as root (administrator on windows), (such as ping) so make sure to run it as so if you do not want undesired behavior

## Dynamic Json Config

- dynamic json config file
- to use the defualt for a value just remove it from the config file
